## 🔹 GitHub
- Manages version control with **main (production)** and **dev (development)** branches.  
- Pull Requests enforce collaboration, approval, and status checks.  
- Prevents direct commits to **main**.  

---

## 🔹 TeamCity
- Acts as our **Continuous Integration** system.  
- Builds the **Java app**, runs automated unit tests, and reports results.  
- Provides status checks that must pass before merging **PRs**.  

---

## 🔹 Jenkins
- Specializes in building **container images**.  
- Uses **Jenkinsfile** to automate Docker builds and push images to **DockerHub**.  
- Ensures every build has a versioned tag and a moving latest tag.

---

## 🔹 DockerHub
- Central registry for all container images.  
- Acts as the trigger source for Spinnaker pipelines.  

---

## 🔹 Spinnaker
- Orchestrates **continuous delivery**.  
- Deploys canary first, then promotes to stable if successful.  
- Integrates with DockerHub to auto-trigger on new images.  

---

## 🔹 Istio
- Service mesh that controls **traffic routing**.  
- Splits traffic between **stable** and canary deployments.  
- Provides observability into rollout performance.

## 🔹 Kubernetes
- Hosts the application workloads.  
- Ensures **five healthy replicas** are always running.  
- Provides scaling, self-healing, and deployment orchestration.
